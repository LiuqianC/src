	<p>Description: This program is a Python based simulation model that can be used to simulate resource sharing in a multi-intelligent system.

You can change the settings of the simulation by changing the concentration of food and the number of agents in the environment.

You can save the images of each iteration during the simulation and merge them into a GIF animation when the simulation is complete.

You can use the program output to evaluate the success of the simulation.</p>
